# Machine Learning Assignment Code in C++

In order to speed up the learning speed for weaker computers and the desire to sharpen my cpp programming skill, I decided to rewrite the **Octave** code in **C++**.

---------------------------------------------------
## Eigen
This project used **Eigen** to implement vectorized programming.

-----------------------------------------------------
## Progess
Compeleted **Linear regression** *Cost function* and *Gradient descent*.  
The next step is to rewrite the *fmincg function* in the excercise file provided by course **Machine Learning** taught by **Andrew Ng**.
